# Server

This directory contains the Node.js server application for the portfolio-two project.

## File Structure

- `src/app.js`: This file is the main file for the Node.js server application. It sets up the Express server and defines the routes.

- `src/routes/index.js`: This file exports a router that handles the routes for the server application.

- `src/controllers/exampleController.js`: This file exports a controller that handles the logic for the example route.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm in the server directory. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the Node.js server application.

## Getting Started

To run the server application, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the server directory.

2. Start the server by running `npm start`.

## API Routes

- `/api/example`: This route is handled by the `exampleController` and returns an example response.

For more information, refer to the documentation in the individual files.
